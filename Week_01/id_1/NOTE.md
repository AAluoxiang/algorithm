1.LeetCode 26 : I'm confused what is In situ sorting? Even if I looked up the answer in baike;

2.LeetCode 189 :  The first idea is use two layers of circulation, the variable of first layer of circulation  is numbers of times K, next    ,the variable is  length of array;  Time complexity is O(k*n),space complexity is O(1);To be exact, time complexity is O(n* k%=n) ;
   Code review by refer to others , three of inversion ,the code is very clean , what's more the time complexity  is getting      shorter,O(n),exactly , O(2n);
